# password-manager-cs128h

Project Outline: Rust CLI Password Manager

Project Structure

Modules:
      - `main.rs`: Entry point, command-line argument handling
      - `commands.rs`: Define commands (login, create, delete, list, update, etc.)
      - `storage.rs`: Handles data encryption, storage, and retrieval
      - `integration.rs`: Manages browser/website interaction
      - `utils.rs`: Utility functions (encryption helpers, domain parsing, etc.)

Core Features

Command Line Interface (CLI)
Commands:
      - `create {domain} {username} {password}`: Save new credentials for a domain
      - `delete {domain}`: Remove credentials for a specified domain
      - `update {domain} {username} {password}`: Update existing credentials
      - `login {domain}`: Retrieve and autofill credentials on the target website
      - `list`: Display all saved domains and usernames
      - `help`: List all commands 
      - `exit` or `quit`: Exit the program

CLI Design:
      - Use the `clap` crate for command-line parsing and argument handling
      - Integrate clear and user-friendly error handling messages

Secure Storage of Credentials

Encryption:
Use AES-256 encryption with a master password to encrypt credentials
Leverage the `rust-crypto` or `ring` crate for secure encryption and decryption

Password Hashing:
Hash and securely store the master password using PBKDF2 or Argon2 (via `argon2` crate)

Data Storage:
Store data in a local SQLite database or as an encrypted JSON file
Structure storage with fields like `domain`, `username`, `password`, and timestamps for creation/last update

Secure Master Key Storage:
Prompt for the master password on every use, avoiding caching it in memory for long sessions
Optionally integrate with system keychain services for enhanced security

Autofill and Interaction with Web Browser

Browser Integration:
Use the `open` crate to open a browser tab for the provided domain if needed
Implement a Rust-based HTTP client or integrate with a web extension (optional, for more secure autofill)
Autofill capabilities could leverage simulated keyboard events (for basic use) or work with WebDriver for cross-browser support

Domain-based Credential Retrieval

Parse and standardize domains so the user doesnâ€™t need exact URLs (`example.com` matches `https://example.com/*`)
Regex or domain-parsing crate to consistently handle subdomains and protocols

Additional Features

Password Generation:
Add a `generate` command to create secure passwords (customizable length, special characters)
Option to automatically save generated passwords under a `create` command

Password Expiry Notifications:
Store a timestamp when credentials are created/updated
Notify users if a password has not been updated for a set duration (e.g., 90 days)

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Support (optional):
Enable users to save and retrieve 2FA tokens (e.g., TOTP codes)
Integrate TOTP generation (using `otpauth` crate) for 2FA

Data Backup and Restore:
Add commands to export and import encrypted credential backups

Security Features:
Implement a command `lock` that requires re-authentication with master key
Automatic clipboard clearing after a set time when copying passwords
